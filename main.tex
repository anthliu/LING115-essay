A programming language is a set of instructions that tell a computer
what actions to perform. Every application that runs on a computer
is written using a programming language.
%
If you've heard of
most popular languages used today, \textit{C, Java, Python}, etc, you may
wonder - Why don't we use natural languages such as English to
program? Surely programming in English is easier to learn and to teach
than a programming language?
%
In fact, using natural languages to create programs has been the goal
of many computer science researchers (Veres). However, the fact remains
that none of these efforts are truly using the ``full capacity" of
a natural language such as English in programming.

Consider an analogy of writing a list of instructions for baking
a cake. Though the instruction of \textit{1. Bake the cake.} may be humorous
in its lack of information, the instruction is an essentially correct
recipe of making a cake. The ambiguities of natural language
cause them to be unsuitable for programming.
%
Even the mundane \textit{x. Stir dry ingredients in bowl until mixed.}
is equally uninformative. Stir which ingredients?
What does it mean for ingredients to be mixed? How does one stir ingredients?
With a spoon? Clockwise? Of course, to the average cook, these questions are
irrelevant and can answered by common sense. However, when telling a
\textit{computer} to bake a cake, what does common sense mean? Does a
computer know what it means to stir ingredients?
%
By using natural language to write a recipe, we are left with
problems caused by ambiguities and a lack of precision.
Programming languages must be exact. The programmer and the computer
both agree on how a program should be executed.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\caption{Guess the number game in Python}
\begin{lstlisting}
answer = '42'
guess = input()
while guess != answer:
    guess = input()
print('You win!')
\end{lstlisting}
\label{fig:guess_number}
\end{figure}

Though natural language is unsuitable for direct use as a programming
language, its influence and usage in programming languages is undeniable.
In Figure \ref{fig:guess_number}, we show a simple ``Guess the number" game
in the programming language \textit{Python}.
The meaning of the program can be easily deciphered only using knowledge
of English. Knowledge that most programming languages are evaluated line
by line from top to bottom is also crucial. Set the \textit{answer} to be 42.
Let the user set the value of \textit{guess}.
While the value of \textit{guess} is not the same value
as the value of \textit{answer},
let the user set the value of \textit{guess} (the \textit{!=} word is an approximation
for the mathematical inequality symbol $\neq$.).
Finally, print (or display on the screen), ``You win!".

The reason for most programming language's usage of natural languages
in their design and implementation is twofold - 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The general idea of programming languages is the same as natural
language - to put ideas into words. When a programming language needs
a word to describe an idea, that idea is often already encoded into
a word of natural language.
\item As alluded to earlier, a primary goal of programming language
designers and programmers is to have programming languages be both easy to
learn and understand. Like a large manuscript, the greatest applications
will have many subsections rewritten and modified when new features are
added or old features are broken. This need is amplified when large
teams must work on the same project, where programmers must read and
understand their respective programs to build upon it.
(As an example, as of 2014, the code
for Facebook has over 9.9 \textit{million} lines of code (Pearce).)

The most \textit{natural} way humans communicate is through natural
language. The incorporation of natural language into programming
increases our understanding.
